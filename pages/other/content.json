Some projects were a simple exercise, but for most we were required to put in some creative work by brainstorming and thumbnailing a variety of ideas and then selecting one or more to go forward with.","Many of the early assignments were just meant to teach us p5.js (and JavaScript in general – though I was already familiar with it), but later on I had some fun with some different algorithms and whatnot. For one project, we had to create an unorthodox clock. I used Perlin noise loops to generate a [virtual cross-section of a tree : https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2003610] that would add one ring each year throughout the century. You can check back in the future to see its progress! I also made a [second clock : https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2009324], inspired by [Scale of the Universe : https://scaleofuniverse.com/en], that displays different time intervals at different scales which the user can zoom in/out of.","I also enjoyed experimenting with different visual styles and ways of drawing. For a random walk assignment, I tried an [ink-blot-esque style : https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2022490], which I achieved by drawing with very low opacity and many iterations per frame. I experimented with different blend modes to get the desired result. For [a variation : https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2022708] of that sketch, I used the additive blend mode and a color-changing stroke to draw a hyper-detailed grid-like image where more-traveled areas become brighter.","[This diffusion-limited aggregation sketch : https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2023248] uses distance checks to determine how close a given particle is to a \"tree\" of connected particles. The closer a particle is to the tree, the bigger and brighter it appears, creating the illusion that the tree is growing. Additionally, I used recursion to propagate up the tree structure to make lines closer to the root larger, making it look like a bunch of roots or branches.","I'm also fairly proud of [this : https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2032674] sketch, which was for an assignment to create an unorthodox drawing program. I decided to create something that the user could interact with to create interesting images, so I ended up with this sketch where drawn lines propagate out in a direction that rotates over time based on the position of the line's endpoint on the canvas. I added some extra features like a grid and symmetry to give the user some more control. I think this can result in some pretty cool artwork, and little tools like this are something that interest me. Perhaps in the future I'll expand upon something like this."]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{"Type":"Creative Coding","Medium":"p5.js","Time Frame":"2023"}}},{"name":"Dack Brokn","shortDesc":"Interactive Story","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{"Type":"Interactive Narrative","Medium":"Twine","Time Frame":"2023"}}},{"name":"Snake Evolution","shortDesc":"Snake Game Neuroevolution Sim","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{"Type":"Creative Coding/ML","Medium":"HTML5 Canvas/JS","Time Frame":"2022"}}},{"name":"King of Games","shortDesc":"Yu-Gi-Oh!
