{"title":"Music","layout":2,"infoBox":{"image":"N/A","data":{}},"text":[{"heading":"Background","paragraphs":["My parents are both musicians, so it's no surprise I got into music as well. In elementary school, I started messing around in GarageBand – just sequencing loops together and calling it my own music – and also started taking piano and cello lessons. I played cello in my school orchestra until my senior year of high school, and though I stopped playing piano due to stress and a lack of interest in classical music, I got back into it in high school because I wanted to play songs from my favorite games and anime. I also learned guitar and ukulele and started to seriously get into songwriting in high school.","In college, I joined two bands, Plus One and PNKY PKN, in which I played keyboard. I also have put out a decent amount of music on my own, including a small EP, soundtracks for a few games, and some background music for YouTube.","I enjoy experimenting with a wide range of genres, including jungle/DnB, trance, house, funk, jazz fusion, rock, and metal and draw influences from a variety of artists as well. Some of my favorites are Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, Xenoblade X), OK Goodnight, Lost Horizon, Chronologist, Ben Folds, Dave Weckl, and Casiopea."]}],"gallery":[{"name":"Raw Metal","shortDesc":"Rock/DnB Game Soundtrack","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{"Released":"March 19, 2024","Genre":"Stealth/Action","My Role":"Lead Programmer, Composer, Concept Artist, UI Designer","Dev Time":"2 Years"}}},{"name":"Studio PolyGroup","shortDesc":"YouTube Channel Soundtrack","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{}}},{"name":"The Marked","shortDesc":"Atmospheric Game Soundtrack","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{}}},{"name":"Moon Looks Red Tonight","shortDesc":"Spooky EP","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{}}},{"name":"Plus One","shortDesc":"Funk/Pop Cover Band","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{}}},{"name":"PNKY PKN","shortDesc":"Original Jazz Fusion Band","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{}}},{"name":"UpRooted","shortDesc":"RPG Game Soundtrack","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"","videoURL":"","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":[]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{}}}]}
