I grew up with an early interest in computers, storytelling, and game design, often creating my own rules for board games when playing with my parents. Over time, my creative interests turned into things I wanted to seriously pursue, so I began learning about programming, game design, music, and so on.","I love action movies, stylized animation, philosophy, cool characters with big swords, and colorful games that are fun to control! My dream is to become creative director of a larger-scale character action game or RPG one day, but for now I'm doing whatever I can to keep honing my skills."]},{"heading":"Education & Extracurriculars","paragraphs":["I attended the Advanced Academics Program at my elementary school, later taking honors and AP courses in middle and high school. I was accepted to the Game Design and Development program at the Rochester Institute of Technology and graduated [i : summa cum laude] in the Fall semester of 2023.","Prior to college, I engaged in many extracurricular activities such as orchestra, FIRST LEGO League, and a game development club, of which I was president. Throughout college I spent most of my time outside of class working part-time jobs, developing personal projects, or working on music for the two bands I joined."]},{"heading":"Career","paragraphs":["Most recently, I worked on [Raw Metal : #games.raw-metal], my first commercial game. I worked in a small team as the programmer/composer on the project and also contributed a bit to some other aspects of development. The game released on March 19th, 2024, after about two years of development, to positive reception on Steam and has sold over 6,500 units as of July 2024. I am working on bug-fixes for the game as well as a set of improvements that we plan to release over the next four to six months.","I've worked a few jobs as a teaching assistant for college courses in game design and development taught in C# – one using MonoGame and one using Unity. I also worked as a lab technician at RIT's Interactive Games and Media computer labs, helping other students with code and other technical issues."]},{"heading":"Accomplishments & Accolades","paragraphs":["- Gold Medal, Scholastic Art & Writing awards, for [Delta A.R.C. : #games.delta-arc]"]}],"gallery":[{"name":"Nest","shortDesc":"Short Film Soundtrack","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"preview-nest.png","videoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzGA5YSziLk?si=aidhuoSiVauD7Yh7","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":["I composed the music for my friend Corrigan's college capstone film project Nest. We had previously worked together on [Raw Metal : #games.raw-metal] and some other minor personal projects, so I had some experience working with him and composing music for projects of his. He gave me a general idea of the type of music he was envisioning (a hardcore song incorporating both synths and acoustic/traditional instruments to represent both the futuristic wasteland and natural scenery and characters) and I wrote and recorded something timed out to the rough cut of the film. I was also asked to make some adjustments here, such as including a more prominent stinger when the bow wielder first attacks the raiders and toning down the intensity on the drums and bass, which originally were stronger and in a distorted hardcore EDM style. As with Raw Metal, I enjoyed composing and timing music to an animation and found enjoyment in the challenges of instrumentating and composing something to properly fit the scene being depicted."]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{"Genre":"Folk/Electronic/Dance","Software":"Logic Pro X","Instruments":"Keyboard"}}},{"name":"Raw Metal","shortDesc":"Rock/DnB Game Soundtrack","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"preview-rm.png","videoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?si=25RrWpP0MIGtf8bu&amp;list=PLSLsB9wTDpMbOJkC7VrgIJ3rmFsz03UwK","linkURL":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2279600/Raw_Metal/","linkTitle":"Steam Page w/Demo","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":["[Raw Metal : #games.raw-metal] is a game I helped make along with some friends of mine. In addition to coding the game and providing some [concept art : art.raw-metal], I composed and recorded the game's soundtrack. The lead designer provided some reference for the general style of music to go for, and I went off of that when composing. I took inspiration from a variety of sources, namely Xenoblade X and Vertigo as well as some prog rock bands such as OK Goodnight and Chronologist. For this project, I created dynamic music – each song has multiple parts that are transitioned between depending on the game state. For instance, the standard level songs have a stealth, pursuit, and combat section. The boss songs have an intro, phase 1, phase transition, phase 2, and outro section. I especially enjoyed working on the boss songs because I got to time the music with the intro/phase transition cutscenes. I think I did an especially good job with this in the music for the third boss, which gets very dramatic in those cutscenes. Similarly to my work on [UpRooted : #music.uprooted], I worked with feedback to adjust songs where necessary. This is also one of the only music projects I've worked on where some of the drums were actually recorded on a real (electronic) drum set (although I think I only did that for one or two songs, as I'm pretty new to drumming and am a bit more comfortable programming drum patterns on a keyboard)."]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{"Genre":"Rock/DnB","Software":"Logic Pro X","Instruments":"Keyboard, Guitar, Drums"}}},{"name":"Studio PolyGroup","shortDesc":"YouTube Channel Soundtrack","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"preview-polygroup.png","videoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?si=ooFpGUTSsHdYSTSz&amp;list=PL3wo7yv14vnoxqWra3VkoDjnZ7Bw0yf_g","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":["Studio PolyGroup is a YouTube channel run by some friends of mine that offers short, fun tutorials about 3D asset creation (modeling, animation, etc.).

I took inspiration not only from the provided reference but also from future funk, lo-fi, and 90s dance songs I enjoyed.

I also composed and recorded the music for it. The soundtrack for the game was inspired by other visual novels such as Steins;Gate and Umineko, and was intended to have a sort of chill \"hanging out\" vibe for the most part. Of course, some scenes require more tense music to fit the mood, so the music in those parts was created accordingly. It's hard to classify the genre for this game's music, but I was originally going for something midwest emo-ish and sort of ambient. Personally, my favorite track is probably \"quelle\" – I think I got a lot of mileage out of just moving the same riff around over and over. It creates kind of a cyclical, mysterious feeling which matches the character of Quelle."]}],"infoBox":{"image":"","data":{"Genre":"Various","Software":"Logic Pro X","Instruments":"Keyboard, Guitar"}}},{"name":"Rise By Night","shortDesc":"Spooky EP","includeInSlideshow":false,"slideshowImg":"","previewImg":"preview-rise-by-night.png","videoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?si=GGkEq2LTE78KkAU5&amp;list=PL3wo7yv14vnokyyXLxj93Hym-s25ENVGI","linkURL":"","linkTitle":"","text":[{"heading":"","paragraphs":["Rise By Night is a short EP I made for Halloween 2023. I love the so-called \"spooky season,\" so I thought it would be fun to put together some themed music for it. The songs are largely in a rock/funk style with certain elements included to give them a spooky vibe, such as a church organ or the marimba to evoke the sound of a skeleton's bones. The final track, Dry Autumn Sunset, has a very different sound as more of a chill lo-fi piano track. I wanted to create a song that captured the feeling of watching the orange leaves fall as the sun went down, so I tried to make it very relaxing. I didn't spend much time on this EP, but I think it turned out well since I avoided overthinking or over-producing it. This EP also marks the start of me getting better at mastering my music.

I mostly played keyboard in this band, and learned most of our songs through a combination of online chord charts and my own ear. I also played guitar briefly when we played Larnell Lewis' song Rejoice. Learning and playing music in a group was a great experience for me. I had been in orchestra previously but had not yet had the experience of being in a student-led band playing more popular styles of music. Being in this band is also a large part of what got me into jazz fusion, as the other band members were interested in it.
